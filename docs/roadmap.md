# Commerce Integration API — Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased approach for building, deploying, and evolving the Commerce Integration API into a full data platform.

---

## Phase 1 — Core API Deployment (Completed)

### Objective

Deploy a working, cloud-hosted API for portfolio use and demonstration.

### Scope

* FastAPI application

* PostgreSQL database (AWS RDS)

* Core endpoints:

  * Feeds (upload)
  * Jobs (status tracking)
  * Products (query with filtering, sorting, pagination)

* Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

---

### AWS Components

* ECS Fargate (containerized API)
* ECR (Docker image repository)
* RDS (PostgreSQL)
* Application Load Balancer (public access)

---

### Deliverables

* Deployed API accessible via ALB
* Working `/docs` Swagger UI
* Production-style README and documentation
* Containerized deployment workflow

---

### Key Outcomes

* Implemented end-to-end ingestion workflow
* Deployed containerized API to AWS
* Resolved real-world issues:

  * Container image not found (ECR)
  * Database connectivity (security group configuration)

---

### Resume Line (Phase 1)

Deployed a containerized Commerce Integration API to AWS (ECS Fargate, RDS, ALB), implementing data ingestion workflows, database persistence, and production-style API documentation.

---

## Phase 2 — Documentation & Portfolio Polish

### Objective

Make the project easy to understand and compelling for hiring managers.

### Enhancements

* Modular Markdown documentation
* Architecture documentation (current)
* Expanded API reference (feeds, jobs, products)
* Deployment guide
* Sample datasets (CSV feeds)

---

### Optional Enhancements

* Architecture diagram (recommended)
* Documentation hosting (S3 + CloudFront)
* Screenshots of AWS infrastructure

---

### Deliverables

* Complete, structured documentation set
* Clear navigation and cross-referencing
* Portfolio-ready repository

---

## Phase 3 — Data Pipeline (ETL Layer)

### Objective

Extend the API into a data pipeline demonstrating ETL concepts.

### Features

* Store uploaded files in S3 (raw data layer)

* ETL processing step (Python script or Lambda):

  * Validate
  * Clean
  * Normalize

* Load processed data into PostgreSQL

---

### Concepts Demonstrated

* Batch data ingestion
* Data transformation
* Data quality validation
* Pipeline orchestration

---

### Optional Enhancements

* Error reporting (invalid rows)
* Feed versioning
* Retry logic

---

### Resume Line (Phase 3)

Implemented ETL pipelines for ingesting and transforming partner data, including validation, normalization, and structured storage for downstream querying.

---

## Phase 4 — Analytics Layer

### Objective

Enable business intelligence use cases using product and order data.

### Data Model Additions

* Orders table
* Relationships:

  * Product
  * Partner
  * Time

---

### Analytics Use Cases

* Sales by product
* Sales by partner
* Sales over time
* Aggregations (daily, monthly)

---

### Concepts Demonstrated

* Dimensional modeling
* Analytical querying
* Aggregation strategies

---

### Deliverables

* Example SQL queries
* Documented analytics scenarios

---

## Phase 5 — Security & Compliance

### Objective

Demonstrate secure handling of sensitive data aligned with real-world practices.

### Features

* Encryption in transit (HTTPS via ALB)
* Encryption at rest (RDS, S3)
* Controlled database access (security groups)
* API authentication (API key)

---

### Documentation Areas

* Data classification (PII vs non-PII)
* Security controls
* High-level compliance considerations (PCI DSS concepts)

---

### Concepts Demonstrated

* Secure architecture design
* Data protection
* Governance practices

---

### Resume Line (Phase 5)

Implemented secure cloud architecture with controlled database access, API authentication, and encryption practices aligned with real-world compliance considerations.

---

## Long-Term Enhancements (Optional)

* Athena for querying S3 data
* AWS Glue for managed ETL
* Redshift for data warehousing
* Dashboard integration (e.g., BI tools)
* Multi-instance ECS scaling
* Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation or Terraform)

---

## Strategy Summary

1. Deploy early (Phase 1) — completed
2. Polish documentation (Phase 2) — in progress
3. Add data pipeline capabilities (Phase 3)
4. Introduce analytics layer (Phase 4)
5. Expand security and compliance (Phase 5)

This phased approach ensures a working portfolio project is available early while enabling structured expansion into a full data platform.

---

## Positioning Statement

This project demonstrates the ability to design, implement, deploy, and document a modern backend system, including API development, cloud infrastructure, data ingestion workflows, and scalable architecture design.
